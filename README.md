# Fraud detection
Fraud detection in E commerce using python and tensorflow. Over the last few years, there has been an increasing trend in demand for the application of fraud detection models within the field of data science â€” especially when it comes to the detection of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent actions.A recurrent neural network is used for this system and is then fine tuned for better performance overall.
